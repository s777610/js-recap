// Object-oriented JavaScript
/* 
  - OOP: basic idea is that you use objects to represent real world
  things. Objects have own properties and functions (methods) 
  - Objects can contain data and other code to represent info about 
  what you're trying to model
  - Data / methods inside the object is encapsulated
  - In classic OOP, class is defined, then, when an instance of that
  class is created, all the properties and methods are copied(!!!) over
  to the instance
  - JavaScript is dynamic and does not provide a traditional 
  class implementation per se. 
  - JavaScript inheritance is prototype based
  - Each object has a private property called the prototype
  - The prototype can have a prototype of its own 
  - Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object
  which sits on top of the prototype chain.
  - The prototype property's value is an object
  - Think of it as a bucket to store properties and methods
  - Prototype as a template and can have prototype properties 
  of its own
  - "The prototype property is where inherited members are defined" -MDN
